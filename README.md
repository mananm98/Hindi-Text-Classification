# Natural Language Processing in Hindi
- State of the Art Hindi Language Model and Classifier
- Language Model trained on Hindi Wikipedia Articles
- Classifier trained on Hindi Movie reviews Dataset


## Datasets
- [Hindi Wikipedia Articles Dataset]()
- [Hindi Movie Reviews Datset](https://www.kaggle.com/disisbig/hindi-movie-reviews-dataset)

### Wikipedia Articles Dataset
- The Hindi Wikipedia Articles was created using wikipedia dump file, the **latest** file containing all the Hindi articles and pages can be downloaded from https://dumps.wikimedia.org/hiwiki/latest/hiwiki-latest-pages-articles.xml.bz2

- Wikipedia Articles Dataset can be built for any language with the latest Articles, by replacing the **WP-Code** of the chosen language in this URL `https://dumps.wikimedia.org/{hi}wiki/latest/{hi}wiki-latest-pages-articles.xml.bz2`. Here, **hi** is the code for Hindi Language.

- **WP-code** is the Language code used by wikipedia to refer to a language. The list of codes can be found [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Wikipedias)

- Hence, we can build Language Models for other languages very easily using Wikipedia data

### Hindi Movie Reviews Dataset
- This dataset was downloaded from this amazing [repo](https://github.com/goru001/nlp-for-hindi) by **Gaurav Arora**. Check out his [github](https://github.com/goru001), he has done great work for other Indian languages as well.
